      <p>Hi, I'm Andy and I am a games programmer who makes 2D computer games that work 
					on the web, desktop browser, mobile phone, or games for the App stores.</p>
				
			<p>I use the flexible Phaser.js framework to create games, but have also extended
				this framework to do even more than is posible with it alone.</p>

			<p>I have put together a showcase of some of the games, and demo games I 
				have worked on, which give an idea of what I can do.  This is the tip of the
				iceberg, as web games are still in their infancy, and I am exploring new ideas and
				projects all the time to create new interactive visuals.</p>
			<p>I have also built Android apps using the Ionic framework and
				Angular.js</p>

					<p>A remake of the 90's single screen dog-fight game Biplane Duel.  A side view of
						a landscape with two biplane aeroplanes that take off, perform acrobatics and duel.
						First to 8 points wins!</p>
					<p>I designed the controls to mimic the tight and quick feel of the original Amiga 
						game, even down to the engine stall if you climb to steeply.</p>

						have one month to build a game on the 'Throwback' theme.
					</p>
					<p>Github hosted a Game Off with over 2500 people joined.</p>

          <p>I am making my own take on the classic turn based Tanks game.  A 2D game of skill
						and tactics where you aim your tanks cannon and judge the shots trajectory to hit your enemy.  
						I beefed up the idea and removed the turns, added an aiming guide, and let players "draw"
						they're own walls and defences to block oponents missiles.</p>
					<p>Potential for future internet multiplay and extra weapons</p>

          <h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Under the hood</h4>
          <p>Using Phaser.js, but 
							with a custom camera routine to allow the screen to zoom out when you shoot your cannon
							at the distant enemy.  The game has a custom destroyable bitmap landscape, and a trajectory 
							setting joypad.  Also note the bouncing bomb on level two, which calculates the surface
							normals on a bitmap when colliding with the landscape.</p>

					<p>In a team of three where I was the full stack developer, LunchAlert was made 
						for a
						Sandwich delivery van business.  It has since grown to be used at hundreds of 
						business parks around the UK.  The app allows marketing promotions to be pushed out 
						to all a companys	customers, including push notifications.</p>
					<h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">National Award Winner!</h4>
					<p>
							In 2017, LunchAlert won the New sandwich product of the year award in the 
							British Sandwich Industries award show The Sammies.  This was covered in 
							<a href="http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/15394843.App_designed_to_feed_hungry_office_workers_tastes_success_at_national_sandwich_awards/">

					<h3 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Planet Hopper</h3>
					<p>A small game demo written using the HTML5 canvas element.  The rocket is controlled 
						with the cursor keys and can explore a wrap around scrolling planet.</p>
					<h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Space</h4>
					<p>If you venture
						high enough, the sky changes colour as you pass through different atmosphere layers,
						and eventually enter space.  The game then seemlessly zooms out and you orbit the 
						planet from space in a different game mode.
					</p>
					<p>I dont currently have a demo online, but may one day convert it to Phaser and continue
						this game, expanding it to have missions to collect items on different planets, asteroids,
            underground caves and alien forests.

					<p>For a marketing company client I developed an Asteroids based game. 
						ou are a rocket in space holding off a fleet of	attacking flying saucers.
						Your rocket is controlled with the cursor keys or an onscreen joystick for mobile.</p>

					<h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">More than just graphics</h4>
					<p>Making games playable is an artform in itself, and I put thought into the way
						the rocket is controlled and moves to get a fun "feel".</p>
					<p>An air friction routine
						was added to give the rocket punchy acceleration at low speeds, but limit maximum speed
            so it doesnt fly too fast, making collision courses with off screen obstacles unavoidable.
