      <p>Hi, I'm Andy Ballard and I am a web developer and 2D games programmer. I make
				HTML5 games that work on the web so they can be embeded in a website, and 
				seamlessly work on desktop or mobile.  They can also be packaged in an app.</p>
				
			<p>I use the flexible Phaser.js framework to create games, and have extended
				the capabilities of the framework further in some projects.  Phaser can also 
				be used to create interactives and visuals on a website, which makes your site
				stand out from flat pages.  Interactives could be a quiz or puzzle, or collect
			  data and email addresses from users.</p>

			<p>I have put together a showcase of some of the games, and demo games I 
				have worked on, which give an idea of what I can do.  I can work alone
				or as part of a team.  
				</p>
			
				<p>I also build hybrid Android apps using the Ionic framework and
				Angular.js</p>

						a landscape with two biplane aeroplanes that take off, perform acrobatics and duel.
						First to 8 points wins!</p>
					<p>I designed the controls to mimic the tight and quick feel of the original Amiga 
						game, even down to the engine stall if you climb to steeply.</p>

					<p>Github hosted the Game Off and over 2500 people joined.</p>

          <p>I am making my own take on the classic turn based Tanks game.  A 2D game of skill
						and tactics where you aim your tanks cannon and judge the shots trajectory to hit your enemy.  
						I beefed up the idea and removed the turns, added an aiming guide, and let players "draw"
						they're own walls and defences to block oponents missiles.</p>
					<p>Potential for future internet multiplay and extra weapons</p>

          <h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Under the hood</h4>
          <p>Using Phaser.js, but 
						with a custom camera routine to allow the screen to zoom out when you shoot your cannon
						at the distant enemy.  The game has a custom destroyable bitmap landscape, and a trajectory 
						setting joypad.  Also note the bouncing bomb on level two, which calculates the surface
						normals against a changing landscape on collision.</p>

						<img src="img/lunchalert_screenshot1.jpg"/>
					</a>
					<p>In a team of three where I was the full stack developer, LunchAlert was made 
						for a local Sandwich van business.  It has since grown to be used at hundreds of 
						business parks around the UK, including by one of the largest bakeries in the country.</p>
					<p>The app allows marketing promotions to be dynamically pushed out to
						all the delivery vans customers, including push notifications.</p>

					<div class="ui message">
					<h3 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">National Award Winner!</h3>
					<p>
						In 2017, LunchAlert won the New sandwich product of the year award in the 
						British Sandwich Industries award show The Sammies.  This was covered in 
						<a href="http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/15394843.App_designed_to_feed_hungry_office_workers_tastes_success_at_national_sandwich_awards/">

					<h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Technology</h4>
					<p>The App used the Ionic Framework, Angular.js and Cordova, and is on the App Store 
						and Google Play store.  It receives an instant notification when the delivery 
						van arrives, controlled by a maching app the van driver uses.  The app also shows 
						dynamically changable content for promotions.</p>

					<h3 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Planet Hopper</h3>
					<p>A small game demo written using the HTML5 canvas element.  The rocket is controlled 
						with the cursor keys and can explore a wrap around scrolling planet.</p>
					<h4 class="ui header" style="color:#303060;">Space</h4>
					<p>If you venture
						high enough, the sky changes colour as you pass through different atmosphere layers,
						and eventually enter space.  The game then seemlessly zooms out and you orbit the 
						planet from space in a different game mode.
					</p>
					<p>I dont currently have a demo online, but may one day convert it to Phaser and continue
						this game, expanding it to have missions to collect items on different planets, asteroids,
            underground caves and alien forests.

					<p>Making games feel playable is an artform in itself, so I put some thought into 
						the way	the rocket accelerates in this game.</p>
					<p>An air friction routine
						was added to give the rocket 'punchy' acceleration at low speeds, but taper off
						as you get faster.
